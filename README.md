 Hi! I'm Sungjong Oh, and I'm a biologist currently participating in a data engineering boot camp in Seoul, Korea.<br>
 Massive amounts of data is produced from recent biology research and I plan to create value from such data.<br>
 Although my data science journey has just begun, big plans are ahead and I don't have time to waste.
